# Contribution Guide

The purpose of this document is to outline the rules that would act as guides for our coding and collaboration throughout and possibly beyond the development period for `Licit`. Please feel free to contribute in the structure shown below.

  - An issue would be moved to `in progress` and be assigned to you if you reference it in the branch name. Just put the issue number at the beginning of the branch name with a `-` or `_` behind it or anywhere else in the branch name with a '#' in front of it. Below are some example branch names: `123-fix-bug, bug-fix#123 or bug-fix-username/repo#123  (to refernce anissue in another repo).`

 - Using the format `closes #issueNo | Short description` when opening a PR automatically moves the card to `code review` column and it can be that simple.


 - Two branches `release` branch and `develop` have been created, all pull requests should be submitted to the develop branch **only**.
