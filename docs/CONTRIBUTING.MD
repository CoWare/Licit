# Contribution Guide

 - Say you want to work on a branch, you create `feature/#issueNo/ShortDescription` and do `git push`, the card would be moved automatically to the `In progress` session.

 - Using the format `closes #issueNo | Short description` when opening a PR automatically moves the card to `code review` column and it can be that simple.
